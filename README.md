# Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! Graphs

## Overview

Flask-based web application that serves up charts and graphs based on collected statistics and details for the NPR weekly quiz show [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](http://waitwait.npr.org)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- MySQL Server 8.0 or newer (or another MySQL Server distribution based on MySQL Server 8.0 or newer) or MariaDB Server 11.4.2 or newer *(Experimental)*

**Note:** Experimental support for MariaDB Server is only available starting with version 2.9.0 of the application. Older versions of MariaDB Server are not supported.

Also, due to potential incompatibilities with the divergence of MySQL and MariaDB, including the Python Connector libraries, support for MariaDB may not be feasible in the long term.
